## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- Angular CLI 19.x or higher
- Modern web browser with WebSocket support

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
ng serve
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload when you change any source files.

### Code Generation

Angular CLI provides powerful code generation tools:

```bash
# Generate a new component
ng generate component my-component

# Generate a new service
ng generate service my-service

# Generate a new interface
ng generate interface my-interface

# List all available schematics
ng generate --help
```

## Building

Build the application for production:

```bash
# Production build
npm run build
# or
ng build --configuration production
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with Karma:

```bash
npm test
# or
ng test
```

## Architecture

The web interface is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Services**
  - `LogService`: Handles log collection, streaming, and filtering
  - `MetricsService`: Manages system metrics collection and visualization
  - `ServicesService`: Manages service discovery, monitoring, and status tracking
  - `ThemeService`: Controls application theming and user preferences
  - `TimeFormatService`: Handles consistent time formatting across the application
  - `WebsocketService`: Manages WebSocket communication and connection state

- **Components**
  - `ConnectionEventsDialogComponent`: Connection status and event history dialog
  - `LayoutComponent`: Main application layout with responsive navigation
  - `LogsComponent`: Real-time log viewing and filtering interface
  - `MetricsComponent`: System metrics visualization and analysis
  - `ServicesComponent`: Service management and monitoring interface
  - `TopicsComponent`: Topic management and subscriber monitoring interface
  - `ExportComponent`: Reusable data export interface with customization options
  - `ExportCustomizerComponent`: Advanced export configuration dialog with field selection and format options

- **Features**
  - Real-time data updates via WebSocket
  - Responsive layout with Material Design
  - Theme switching with system preference detection
  - Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
  - Service monitoring and management
  - Topic and subscriber management
