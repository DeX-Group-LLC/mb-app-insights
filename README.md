## Architecture

The web interface is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Services**
  - `LogService`: Handles log collection, streaming, and filtering
  - `MetricsService`: Manages system metrics collection and visualization
  - `ServicesService`: Manages service discovery, monitoring, and status tracking
  - `ThemeService`: Controls application theming and user preferences
  - `TimeFormatService`: Handles consistent time formatting across the application
  - `WebsocketService`: Manages WebSocket communication and connection state

- **Components**
  - `ConnectionEventsDialogComponent`: Connection status and event history dialog
  - `LayoutComponent`: Main application layout with responsive navigation
  - `LogsComponent`: Real-time log viewing and filtering interface
  - `MetricsComponent`: System metrics visualization and analysis
  - `ServicesComponent`: Service management and monitoring interface

- **Features**
  - Real-time data updates via WebSocket
  - Responsive layout with Material Design
  - Theme switching with system preference detection
  - Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
  - Service monitoring and management
  - Real-time metrics visualization
  - Log streaming and analysis

- **Design Patterns**
  - Component-based architecture
  - Reactive programming with RxJS
  - Dependency injection
